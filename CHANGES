**0.6.0 (2017.01.15)**

* Include any changes done in v0.5.1
* (Issue #71) Remove `-e` flag for the `install` command as it is not consistent with pip. You can still install from within a virtualenv or by passing a full path to `wagon` within the venv.
* (Issue #66) Remove non-standard `distribution` and `release` tags from wagon archive name to be consistent with wheel's naming convention. That information is still stored in the wagon archive's metadata
* (Issue #81) Create `zip` instead of `tar.gz` by default to be consistent with `pip wheel`
* (Issue #52) Add WIP `repair` command which will use auditwheel to repair a wagon for `manylinux1`
* (Issue #64) Move `virtualenv` to extra requirements as it is only required by `validate` and should be explicitly installed. See README
* Fix `distribution` key name in metadata, which was faulty
* Add `distro` (https://github.com/nir0s/distro) linux distro identification support as `platform.linux_distribution()` is deprecated and will be removed in Python 3.7
* (Issue #80) Improve UX of help messages
* (Issue #72) Set verbosity only once by using the `wagon.set_verbose()` function instead of setting it up every time in each API call
* (Issue #72) Remove log-level from log messages to be consistent with pip
* (Issue #72) Change default log level to DEBUG
* (Issue #87) Officially support py33, py36 and pypy
* (Issue #89) Replace nose with pytest
* Update python classifiers
* Add MANIFEST.in file (Which includes LICENSE)

** 0.5.1 (unreleased)

* (Issue #59) Fix common platform for multiple wheels incorrectly identified when there are both `manylinux1` and `linux_` wheels.
* (Issue #60) Make platform check more robust
* (Issue #61) No longer fail to install `manylinux1` on linux platforms


**0.5.0 (unreleased)**

* Python 3 support (tested on 3.4 and 3.5)
* Remove the excluded packages feature. You should use pip constraint files instead.
* Replace outta-place (boy..) options with positional arguments (e.g. `wagon create flask` instead of `wagon create -s flask`)
* In validate, remove validation of package.json structure. If someone messed up the wagon so bad that even its metadata isn't intact anymore.. pity.
* Make sure tracebacks show up when not using the CLI
* Change Python API to be.. better (see README)
* Wagon is now a single module
* Remove the file logger. The logger now logs to the shell.
* Fixed a bug where an empty file could be supplied as an archive to `wagon create` and `wagon install`.
* Replace click with argparse (You must install argparse manually if you're on Python 2.6) to remove the dependency.
* Add Classifiers to setup.py
* Remove autodetection of requirement files within an archive or a folder from which you create a wagon. This was a stupid idea in the first place - what was I thinking? Anyway, You can, as before, explicitly provide requirement files via the `-r` flag multiple times.

**0.3.2 (2016-06-15)**

* Fix Wrong pip path on Windows.

**0.3.1 (2016-05-26)**

* Previously, Wagon would use the Python, pip and wheel executables that were in the path, or, if using a virtualenv, those within it. That is, you couldn't use another python that's not in the path. That's now fixed as we're now using the python, pip and wheel relative to the sys.executable path.

**0.3.0 (2015-11-02)**

* Add a `--format` flag allowing to also choose the zip format for the wagon. Default is tar.gz.
* Wagons now have the .wgn extension.
* It is no longer required to provide a package_name==package_version when creating from PyPI. using `wagon create flask` will create a wagon of the latest version of Flask found in PyPI.
* Allow passing arbitrary pip args to the `create` and `install` commands via the `-a` flag. e.g. `wagon create flask -a '--retries 5'`.
* To pack up internal requirement files, you can now simply provide the `-r` flag instead of `-r .` which will look for requirement files within the path/archive. To explicitly provide additional requirement files, you can use the additional pip args feature.

**0.2.5 (2015-10-22)**

* Wagon now officially supports Windows (and is tested via AppVeyor)
* { platform } tag is now generated using wheel's implementation for consistency's sake.

**0.2.4 (2015-10-21)**

* Allow passing arbitrary pip args to wagon create via the wheel-args flag.
* Allow passing arbitrary pip args to wagon install via the install-args flag.

**0.2.3 (2015-10-18)**

* Fixed attempting to install a package's dependencies from a dev-requirements file by using the -r flag failed.

**0.2.2 (2015-10-14)**

* The default logger will no longer override the user's logger when importing wagon.
* Module -> Package (everywhere). Most importantly, the metadata now include package_name and package_version instead of module_name and module_version (what the hell was I thinking?).

**0.2.1 (2015-10-09)**

* Add support for excluding specific packages via the --exclude (-x) flag which can be supplied multiple times. This will be reflected in the metadata.
* Add wagon showmeta -s SOURCE_ARCHIVE which prints out the metadata of a wagon archive.
* OS properties in the metadata are now null when all either creating an archive on OS X or Windows or if the platform is any.
* Archive name now contains the distro and release if creating an archive on Linux which contains non-Pure-Python wheels; but, when irrelevant, archive name will be somewhat like this: cloudify_fabric_plugin-1.2.1-py27-none-any-none-none.tar.gz

**0.2.0 (2015-09-24)**

* Added support for user supplied Python versions.
* Added support for an --ignore-platform flag when installing a module.
* Archive name now includes distro and release for Linux compiled archives so that they're identifiable.
* Much more documentation

**0.1.2 (2015-09-24)**

* Rename Wheelr to Wagon
* Add creation and installation validation.
